- VERY IMPORTANT: always use /frontend/src/lib/api to do api calls. DO NOT use fetch or axios manually!
- IMPORTANT: Backend development requires DATABASE_URL environment variable
  - Set up: `export DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/clay_studio`  
  - Before committing backend changes: `npm run sqlx:prepare` to update query cache
  - Check compilation: `npm run check` (works without DATABASE_URL using existing cache)
- using useState considered code smell, use valtio instead.
- file that has more than 1000 lines is code smell.
- database url is in backend/.env
- never rerun mcp or dev server by yourself
