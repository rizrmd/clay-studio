each client setup, will create a folder .clients/[client_id]
  in there we will download bun in (.clients/bun), and bun add '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'.

  so each client will have their own instance of claude code.

  next in each client run (we call this cli) in a expectr, and capture it's stdout/stderr: 

     `claude setup-token`

  it will show an auth url, show that to user.
  after user visit the url and authroize their account, they will get a setup-token.

  we need that token to be pasted to cli (they are waiting to be pasted)

  after that the cli will output an OAUTH_TOKEN

  we need to store that OAUTH_TOKEN as claude_token in client field.

  and then store it each client .env as per cli instruction
