# Multi-User Projects Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented multi-user project support with private/public conversations for Clay Studio.

## Backend Implementation ✅

### Database Schema
- **Migration**: `20250930_add_multi_user_support.sql`
- **New Table**: `project_members`
  - Tracks user membership with roles (owner/member)
  - Enforces unique constraint on (project_id, user_id)
- **Updated Table**: `conversations`
  - Added `created_by_user_id` (tracks creator)
  - Added `visibility` ('private' or 'public', defaults to 'private')

### Models
- `backend/src/models/project_member.rs`
  - ProjectMember, ProjectMemberRole, ProjectMemberWithUser
  - AddProjectMemberRequest, UpdateProjectMemberRequest, TransferOwnershipRequest

- `backend/src/models/conversation.rs`
  - Added ConversationVisibility enum (Private/Public)
  - Updated Conversation type with visibility fields

### API Endpoints
**Project Members** (`/api/projects/{project_id}/members`):
- `GET /` - List all members
- `POST /` - Add member (owner only)
- `DELETE /{user_id}` - Remove member (owner only)
- `PATCH /{user_id}` - Update member role (owner only)
- `POST /transfer` - Transfer ownership (owner only)

**Conversations** (`/api/conversations`):
- `PATCH /{conversation_id}/visibility` - Toggle private/public

### Access Control
- Projects: Only visible to members (via project_members join)
- Conversations:
  - Public: All project members can see
  - Private: Only creator can see
- Root users bypass all restrictions

### Business Rules
- Cannot remove last owner
- Cannot remove member with existing conversations
- Ownership transfer requires new owner to be existing member
- New conversations default to private
- Creator or project owner can toggle visibility

## Frontend Implementation ✅

### API Utilities
- `frontend/src/lib/api/project-members.ts`
  - listProjectMembers()
  - addProjectMember()
  - removeProjectMember()
  - updateMemberRole()
  - transferProjectOwnership()

- `frontend/src/lib/api/conversations.ts`
  - toggleConversationVisibility()

### Type Updates
- `frontend/src/lib/types/chat.ts`
  - Added `created_by_user_id?: string`
  - Added `visibility?: "private" | "public"`

### UI Components

**1. ProjectMembersDialog** (`components/chat/sidebar/components/project-members-dialog.tsx`)
- Full-featured member management dialog
- Add/remove members
- Update roles (owner/member)
- Transfer ownership with confirmation
- Shows member list with usernames, roles, and actions
- Owner-only actions (add, remove, role changes)
- Prevents removing last owner
- Validates ownership transfer

**2. ConversationVisibilityToggle** (`components/chat/sidebar/components/conversation-visibility-toggle.tsx`)
- Standalone component for toggling visibility
- Shows Lock (private) or Globe (public) icon
- Confirmation dialog before changing
- Toast notifications
- Loading states

**3. Conversation List Updates** (`components/chat/sidebar/components/item.tsx`)
- Added Lock/Globe visibility indicators with tooltips
- Added "Make Public/Private" to dropdown menu
- Inline visibility toggle (no dialog needed in dropdown)
- Icons color-coded (Lock=gray, Globe=blue)

**4. Sidebar Header** (`components/chat/sidebar/components/header.tsx`)
- Integrated "Members" button that opens ProjectMembersDialog
- Passes current user ID for permission checking
- Positioned between back button and other actions

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed conversation content disappearing when list loads
  - Changed `handleConversationList` to preserve existing messages
  - Now merges conversation metadata instead of clearing map

## Usage Examples

### Add a Member to Project
```typescript
import { addProjectMember } from "@/lib/api/project-members";

await addProjectMember(projectId, {
  user_id: "user-uuid-here",
  role: "member" // or "owner"
});
```

### Toggle Conversation Visibility
```typescript
import { toggleConversationVisibility } from "@/lib/api/conversations";

const result = await toggleConversationVisibility(conversationId);
console.log(result.visibility); // "private" or "public"
```

### Check User's Role
```typescript
import { listProjectMembers } from "@/lib/api/project-members";

const members = await listProjectMembers(projectId);
const currentMember = members.find(m => m.user_id === currentUserId);
const isOwner = currentMember?.role === "owner";
```

## UI Features

### Project Members Dialog
- Click "Members" button in sidebar header
- View all project members with roles
- Add new members by user ID
- Change member roles (owner ↔ member)
- Remove members (with validations)
- Transfer ownership with confirmation
- Real-time member list updates

### Conversation Visibility
- Lock icon = Private (gray)
- Globe icon = Public (blue)
- Hover for tooltip explanation
- Click conversation dropdown → "Make Public/Private"
- Instant visibility toggle with toast confirmation

### Visual Indicators
- Sidebar conversation list shows Lock/Globe icon
- Tooltips explain visibility state
- Color coding for quick recognition
- Consistent iconography throughout

## Migration Notes

To apply changes to existing database:

```bash
# Run migration
psql $DATABASE_URL -f backend/migrations/20250930_add_multi_user_support.sql

# Or using sqlx (if configured)
sqlx migrate run
```

Migration automatically:
1. Creates project_members table
2. Adds visibility columns to conversations
3. Backfills existing data (project owners → project_members)
4. Sets existing conversations to private

## Testing Checklist

Backend:
- [x] Backend compiles successfully
- [ ] Migration runs without errors
- [ ] Can add/remove project members
- [ ] Ownership transfer works
- [ ] Conversation visibility filtering works
- [ ] Access control prevents unauthorized actions

Frontend:
- [ ] Members dialog opens and loads members
- [ ] Can add new members
- [ ] Can change member roles
- [ ] Can transfer ownership
- [ ] Visibility indicators show correctly
- [ ] Visibility toggle works
- [ ] Conversation content persists after list load
